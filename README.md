# Dynamic Data Population for Stock Market

Welcome to the **Dynamic Data Population** project! This repository contains the code and resources used to dynamically populate stock market prices on a website, utilizing **Python** and **Flask** to fetch data from a database via custom-built APIs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on populating stock market prices on a website in real-time. Using a set of APIs developed with Python and Flask, the data is fetched from the database and displayed dynamically on the front-end, making sure the stock prices are always up-to-date.

### Features
- **API Development:** Developed APIs to fetch and insert stock market data.
- **Real-Time Data Population:** Integrated APIs to ensure stock prices are updated dynamically on the website.
- **CRUD Operations:** Simplified database management with APIs for inserting, updating, and deleting stock data.
- **Seamless Front-End Integration:** Integrated backend APIs with front-end code for live data population.

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
├── api/
│   ├── stock_data_fetch.py      # Code for fetching stock data from the database
│   ├── stock_data_insert.py     # Code for inserting stock data into the database
│   ├── app.py                   # Main Flask application file

└── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
```

## 💡 How It Works

1. **API Creation:** The APIs were designed to fetch and insert stock data into the database.
2. **Data Fetching:** The stock data is fetched dynamically via these APIs when the user visits the website.
3. **CRUD Operations:** APIs handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting stock records from the database.
4. **Front-End Integration:** The backend APIs were integrated with the frontend code to ensure that stock prices were displayed dynamically, with real-time updates.

## 🔧 Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-data-population.git
   cd dynamic-data-population
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask App**:

   Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python api/app.py
   ```

4. **Check the Front-End**:

   Visit the frontend page (`stock_dashboard.html`) in your browser to see the stock market data populating dynamically.

## 📊 Project Outcomes

- **Real-Time Data Population:** The API successfully fetches and displays stock market data in real-time whenever called.
- **Efficient Database Management:** CRUD operations on the database were simplified through the APIs, allowing smooth data updates and retrieval.
- **Seamless Integration:** Data was dynamically integrated into the website, ensuring an updated view for users at all times.

## 🔍 Future Improvements

Potential improvements include:

- Integrating real-time data feeds for live stock price updates.
- Enhancing the API to handle large volumes of stock data more efficiently.
- Expanding the system to handle other financial data such as stock trends and historical prices.
- Implementing authentication for secure access to the stock data.
